# Polkaviz
Visualization efforts on the Polkadot Network!


## üßê About

The project is an attempt to become an umbrella project for all data visualization efforts on top of the Polkadot ecosystem. 

There are complex concepts and interactions that project will attempt to visualize: 
* How actors nominators, validators, collators, fisherman interact with each other.
* How processes like election in NPoS mechanism happen. 
* How validators and nominators rewards are recorded per session and relayed after an era.


A project funded and supported by [PolkaDAO](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/announcing-polkadao-fund-your-project-1891e6d895a).
